# The Dementia Radio Project

This README is mainly a "how-to" guide on setting up a device. If you want to hear the story on how the project came to be, you can read my blog at https://idonneeda.wordpress.com/tag/dementia-radio/?order=asc

## Required materials 
* A Raspberry Pi. This project has been tested with a model 3B+ but pretty much any Raspberry Pi (save for the Nano) should function, The Zero may work, but it will likely need modification for GPIO pinout.
* An audio device. Anything should work, even USB units, but tested units include the Raspiaudio Mic+ and HiFiBerry Amp2. Make sire you have an appropriate power supply for higher power amps like the Amp2 - read the audio device instructions for information.
* 2 buttons for start/stop
* 1 rotary encoder for volume
